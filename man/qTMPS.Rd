\title{Apply the TMPS model for a typewise statistical estimate of return periods
as well as a combined TMPS return period. See also reference Fischer (2018).}
\usage{
qTMPS(
  p = c(2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000),
  Flood_events,
  Daily_discharge,
  return_TMPS = c("TMPS", "R1", "R2", "R3", "S1", "S2"),
  Threshold_Q = 3,
  p_as_annuality = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The points (return periods) where the quantiles should be calculated
Defaults to: 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}

\item{Flood_events}{data.frame: Floods events with the columns "Peak_date" (Date format), "HQ" (numeric) and "Type" (factor)}

\item{Daily_discharge}{data.frame: Daily discharge (continuous) with columns "Date (Date format) and "Discharge" (numeric)}

\item{return_TMPS}{character vector: What should be returned. Any combination of "TMPS" and the occuring floodtypes}

\item{Threshold_Q}{numeric: Peak of Threshold, defaults to 3}

\item{p_as_annuality}{logical: Should all probabilities be treated as an annuality [in years] instead of dimensionless values between 0 and 1}
